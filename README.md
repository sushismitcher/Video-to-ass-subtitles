# Video-to-ass-subtitles
This project aims to let you watch videos the way they're meant to be watched: in the subtitles. It transforms a mkv video into a .ass subtitle file that you can merge with a video using ffmpeg to then have your original video as an overlay (of subtitles) to your second video.
